To quickly get started, [download the latest pre-built binaries (1.0.0)](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/MSCL/releases/download/v1.0.0/MSCL_1.0.0.zip). 

If you want to build MSCL from source, see the [Build ReadMe](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/MSCL/blob/master/BuildScripts/buildReadme.md).

### What is MSCL?
MSCL is the MicroStrain Communication Library, developed by [LORD Microstrain Sensing Systems](http://microstrain.com) in Williston, VT. It was created to make it simple to interact with our [wireless](http://www.microstrain.com/wireless/sensors) and [wired](http://www.microstrain.com/inertial) sensors.

### Programming Languages
MSCL is written in C++, but by using [SWIG](http://swig.org/) we are able to wrap it into a variety of languages.
The library is currently available in:
* C++
* Python
* .NET (C#, VB, MATLAB, LabView)
